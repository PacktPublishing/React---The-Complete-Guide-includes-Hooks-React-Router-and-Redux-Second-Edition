More on "Authentication Tokens"
When working with "Authentication Tokens", these tokens are typically created in the "JSON Web Token" Format (JWT).

As explained in the previous lecture, those "tokens" are really just long strings which are constructed by an algorithm that encodes data into a string (with help of a private key, only known by the server).
