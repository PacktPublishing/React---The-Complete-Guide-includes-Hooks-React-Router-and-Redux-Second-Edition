A Note About New React Projects & NodeJS
In the next lecture, we will need to install NodeJS (the tool we use for creating React projects uses it).

You will learn how to create React projects and how to download + install NodeJS in the next lecture but make sure that you DON'T download NodeJS version 17! Because at the moment, the created projects won't work with that version.

Instead, download the LTS version of NodeJS. You can download that version via this link (use the "LTS" version): https://nodejs.org/en/download/
