You may want to compare your code to mine (e.g. to find + fix errors).

For that, you find multiple code snapshots for this module here in this Github repository: https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code/tree/17-practice-food-order-http-forms

Usage instructions can be found on the page that link is leading to.

Simply pick one of the snapshots in the /code folder - the subfolder names are chosen such that they are easy to match against lecture names in this course section.

You also find section slides (if available) in that Github repository.
